# Carlo's Favorite Pass-Time

## Yu-Gi-Oh 

**It is a unique deck card game that I play almost religiously.**

1. I love making new strategies to ~~compete against others~~ **Crush The Competition**

2. I watched all the series of the show so it holds a nostalgic factor for me

3. I love the art style that the cards get printed in 

I typically practice with online tools such as [Dueling-Nexus](https://duelingnexus.com/login "Dueling Nexus")
