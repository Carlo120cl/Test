Carlo's Hobby-site

This site is about some of my favorite pass times when I'm not in school, Year Up, or working

Yu-Gi-Oh - is a unique deck card game that I play almost religiously. I love making new strategies to compete against others

Tekken 7 - a fighting game available across PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. I have been playing the Tekken series since Tekken 3, and have loved the series ever since,

Digital Art - I love working on digital art, I primarily work through photoshop. I edit pictures sometimes, I primarily like to draw in the anime art style.
